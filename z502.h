   This include file is used only by the Z502.

   Revision History:
   1.3  July    1992:   Make structures smaller. Reduce size of SECTOR.
   2.0  January 2000:   Small changes
   2.1  May     2001:   Redefine disk layout.  Define HARDWARE_STATS
   2.2  July    2002:   Make code appropriate for undergrads.
   3.0 August   2004:   Modified to support memory mapped IO
   3.1 August   2004:   hardware interrupt runs on separate thread
   3.11 August  2004:   Support for OS level locking
   3.53 NOVEMBER 2011:  Changed CONTEXT so the space allocated for
                        REGs is long - didn't matter until trying
                        to store addresses.
